# PySOP
Python implementations of popular search and optimization algorithms from the ground up.


# Getting Started

For visualizations of each algorithm, use the associated module's CLI. For example, to visualize
gradient descent:

    (env) C:\Users\firstname.lastname> python descent_methods gradient-descent
    
To view avaiable commands for a given module, run the help option:
    
    (env) C:\Users\firstname.lastname> python descent_methods --help
